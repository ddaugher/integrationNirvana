setting up Integration Nirvana

1.  install Apache Camel - http://camel.apache.org/download.html

    - on OSX... I installed apache camel 2.7.2 @ /usr/bin/apache-camel-2.7.2

1a. Apache Camel jar's are located within the APACHE_CAMEL_HOME/lib/ directory

2.  Java Mail jar is already present in directory (integrationNirvana/lib/mail.jar)
3.  Apache Camel Spring jar's are located within Apache Camel install (APACHE_CAMEL_HOME/lib/spring)
4.  Camel Mail jar is located with Apache Camel install (APACHE_CAMEL_HOME/lib/camel-mail-2.7.2.jar)
5.  GrowlWrapper jar is already present in the directory (integrationNirvana/lib/growlwrapper.jar)

Executing the Integration Nirvana demo

The MailReaderWithCamel (contains main()), initiates the Camel Context and starts the process, execute this from 
within an IDE or command line.  The 'mailReader' will check the supplied email account every ten (10) seconds, 
retrieving all emails available at time of checking.  Putting all retreived emails into the 'incomingEmails' queue.

The 'contentRouter' will retrieve messages from the 'incomingEmails' queue and route based on subject.

The 'durable topic consumers' will retrieve messages from their respective topics and publish to downstream queues.

The 'event driven consumers' consuming from these queue's will get/put messages to their appropriate 'Processor'
  - jms:nonFiltered -> GrowlProcessor
  - jms:filtered -> FilteredProcessor
  - jms:winners -> WinnerProcessor

Messages received by the Processors will 'growl' notify received message

The 'graffle' slides are located in the docs directory along with images (png) for the respective slides.  I will
add the final slide presentation, both keynote (.key) and PDF (.pdf) after the final presentation.
